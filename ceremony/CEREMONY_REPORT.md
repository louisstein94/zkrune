## Security Guarantees

The Groth16 trusted setup is secure as long as **at least one participant** was honest and properly deleted their toxic waste (random values used during contribution).

Each contributor added entropy that cannot be reversed. The final ceremony includes:

1. **Phase 1**: Hermez Network's Powers of Tau ceremony with 54 participants
2. **Phase 2**: zkRune community contributions
3. **Final Beacon**: Random value from drand network for additional security

## Verification

Anyone can verify the ceremony by running:

```bash
./scripts/ceremony.sh verify
```

## Files
